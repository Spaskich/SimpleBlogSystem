# SimpleBlogSystem
A simple blog system made using Spring Framework.


## Teamwork Project Assignment for the [SPRING MVC Course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/trainings/1538/java-mvc-frameworks-spring-march-2017)
### General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:
*	The application must be implemented using **SPRING MVC framework**.
 *	The application must have at least 8 web pages (views)
 *	The application must have at least 4 entity models
 *	The application must have at least 4 controllers 
*	Use **IntelliJ or Eclipse**.
 *	Use **Thymeleaf or JSP** template engine for generating the UI.
  *	Use **fragments**.
 *	You could also make the front-end using JavaScript and consuming a rest service from Web API 
*	Use **MySQL/Oracle/PostgreSQL** as a database back-end.
*	Use **Spring Data** to access your database.
 *	User **Hibernate/EclipseLink** or any other provider as a JPA implementation
*	Use responsive design based on **Twitter Bootstrap/Google Material design**.
*	Use the standard **Spring Security** for managing **users** and **roles**.
 *	Your registered users should have at least one of these roles: **user** and **administrator**.
*	Use **AJAX** request to asynchronously load and display data somewhere in your application.
*	Write **unit tests** for your logic, controllers, actions, helpers, etc.
*	Implement **error handling and data validation** to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered (both client-side and server-side).
*	Handle correctly the special **HTML** characters and tags like **<br /> and <script>** (escape special characters).
*	Use at least one **Interceptor**
*	Use **ModelМapper** or other mapping library.
### Additional Requirements
*	Follow the best practices for OO design and **high-quality code** for the Web application:
 *	Use data encapsulation.
 *	Use exception handling properly.
 *	Use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly.
 *	Follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
 *	Correctly format and structure your code, name your identifiers and make the code readable.
*	Well looking user interface (UI).
*	Good usability (easy to use UI).
*	Supporting of all modern Web browsers.
*	Use caching where appropriate.
*	Use a **source control system** by choice, e.g. GitHub, BitBucket.
 *	Submit a link to your public source code repository.
### Public Project Defense
Each student will have to deliver a **public defense** of its work in front of the other students, trainers and assistants. Students will have only **15 minutes** for the following:
*	**Demonstrate** how the application works (very shortly).
*	Show the **source code** and explain how it works.
*	Optionally you might prepare a **presentation** (3-4 slides).
Please be **strict in timing**! On the 15th minute you **will be interrupted**! It is good idea to leave **the last 2-3 minutes for questions** from the other students, trainers and assistants.
Be **well prepared** for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time.
### Bonuses
*	Use **Spring Social** to connect with **Software-as-a-Service** (SaaS) API providers
*	Host the application in a **cloud environment**, e.g. in **Amazon Web Services**.
*	Use a **file storage cloud API**, e.g. **Dropbox, Google Drive** or other for storing the files.
*	Use of features of HTML 5 like Geolocation, Local Storage, SVG, Canvas, etc.
*	Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use.
